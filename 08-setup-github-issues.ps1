   For AKS pod health alerts in the pets namespace:
   1. Scan all namespaces for unhealthy pods first.
   2. Prioritise OOMKilled and CrashLoopBackOff.
   3. For OOMKilled: correlate NODE_OPTIONS / JVM flags against container memory
      limits before adjusting. Apply the minimum necessary increase.
   4. After any patch, wait for rollout, then verify cluster-wide pod health.
   5. After successful resolution, invoke the $SUBAGENT_NAME subagent to create
      a GitHub issue in $GITHUB_REPO with the incident ID, root cause,
      patch applied, and a recommendation to update the source manifest in Git.
